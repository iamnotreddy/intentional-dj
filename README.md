# Intentional DJ

A little utility that uses Spotify's recommendation endpoints and web player SDK to help you find similar tracks based on a set of input tracks. It works best when you know a few tracks with a similar vibe, and you're trying to find other tracks matching that. I built this to help me discover new tracks in very specific subgenres

Some ideas that have worked for me personally:
- Early 90s hip hop: pick a track from Camp Lo, Grand Puba, AZ, Jeru the Damaja
- NYC Drill: pick a track from Pop Smoke, Kay Flock, Sheff G, Fivio Foreign

Very much a WIP in regards to mechanics and UI but it works (kind of)!
